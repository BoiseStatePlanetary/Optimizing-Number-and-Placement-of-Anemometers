%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.31 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls and other external packages such as
%% latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf.  Note that as of 
%% Oct 2020, APS now uses revtex4.2e for its journals but remember that 
%% AASTeX v6+ still uses v4.1. All of these external packages should 
%% already be present in the modern TeX distributions but not always.
%% For example, revtex4.1 seems to be missing in the linux version of
%% TexLive 2020. One should be able to get all packages from www.ctan.org.
%% In particular, revtex v4.1 can be found at 
%% https://www.ctan.org/pkg/revtex4-1.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\documentclass[linenumbers]{aastex631}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[arguments]{aastex631}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Supresses an abstract. Originally for RNAAS manuscripts 
%%                but now that abstracts are required this is obsolete for
%%                AAS Journals. Authors might need it for other reasons. DO NOT
%%                use \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%   linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%   trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations and acknowledgments 
%%                  for dual anonymous review.
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex631}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% Note that in v6.3 "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.
%%
\newcommand{\vdag}{(v)^\dagger}
\newcommand\aastex{AAS\TeX}
\newcommand\latex{La\TeX}

%% Reintroduced the \received and \accepted commands from AASTeX v5.2

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.31
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to 
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group
%% of authors in the collaboration and it takes TWO arguments. The last
%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.
%
%\AuthorCollaborationLimit=2
%
%% will only show Schwarz & Muench on the front page of the manuscript
%% (assuming the \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands are
%% commented out).
%%
%% Note that all of the author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the
%% front end of a long author article more manageable. Please do not use
%% this functionality for manuscripts with less than 20 authors. Conversely,
%% please do use this when the number of authors exceeds 40.
%%
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.
%% This command should only be used with \AuthorCollaborationLimit is used.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It
%% is needed in this document because it uses a mix of latex tabular and
%% AASTeX deluxetables.  In general it should not be needed.
%\setcounter{table}{1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% The following section outlines numerous optional output that
%% can be displayed in the front matter or as running meta-data.
%%
%% If you wish, you may supply running head information, although
%% this information may be modified by the editorial offices.
\shorttitle{Estimating Aerodynamic Properties of Planetary Surfaces Using Drone Attitude}
\shortauthors{Jackson}
%%
%% You can add a light gray and diagonal water-mark to the first page 
%% with this command:
%% \watermark{text}
%% where "text", e.g. DRAFT, is the text to appear.  If the text is

%% \setwatermarkfontsize{dimension}
%% where dimension is any recognized LaTeX dimension, e.g. pt, in, etc.

\title{Estimating Aerodynamic Properties of Planetary Surfaces Using Drone Attitude}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.31 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.31 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.31 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

%\correspondingauthor{August Muench}
%\email{greg.schwarz@aas.org, gus.muench@aas.org}

%% Note that the \and command from previous versions of AASTeX is now
%% depreciated in this version as it is no longer necessary. AASTeX 
%% automatically takes care of all commas and "and"s between authors names.

%% AASTeX 6.31 has the new \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands to
%% provide the collaboration status of a group of authors. These commands 
%% can be used either before or after the list of corresponding authors. The
%% argument for \collaboration is the collaboration identifier. Authors are
%% encouraged to surround collaboration identifiers with ()s. The 
%% \nocollaboration command takes no argument and exists to indicate that
%% the nearby authors are not part of surrounding collaborations.

%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. 
\begin{abstract}
We explore how the vertical spacing and number of anemometers impact estimates of surface roughness and shear velocity.
\end{abstract}

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. 
%% The AAS Journals now uses Unified Astronomy Thesaurus concepts:
%% https://astrothesaurus.org
%% You will be asked to selected these concepts during the submission process
%% but this old "keyword" functionality is maintained in case authors want
%% to include these concepts in their preprints.
\keywords{}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.
%%
%% We recommend that authors also use the natbib \citep
%% and \citet commands to identify citations.  The citations are
%% tied to the reference list via symbolic KEYs. The KEY corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \bibitem in the reference list below. 

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Introduction}

%% For this sample we use BibTeX plus aasjournals.bst to generate the
%% the bibliography. The sample631.bib file was populated from ADS. To
%% get the citations to show in the compiled file do the following:

\section{Model}

The aircraft tilt angle relative to the vertical $\theta$ can be calculated from the pitch $\phi$ and roll $\rho$ angles reported from the telemetry stream:
\begin{equation}
    \tan^2\theta = \tan^2 \phi + \tan^2 \rho.\label{eqn:tilt}
\end{equation}

% Thus,

% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\sigma_{z_\star}}{z_\star} = \sqrt{2} \kappa \sqrt{\frac{2N - 1}{N \left( N + 1\right) } + \frac{12}{\delta x^2 N \left( N^2 - 1 \right) }} \left( \frac{\sigma}{u_\star} \right)\label{eqn:sigma_zstar}
% \end{equation}
% and 
% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\sigma_{u_\star}}{u_\star} = \sqrt{ \frac{12}{N \left( N^2 - 1 \right) } } \left( \frac{\kappa}{\delta x} \right) \left( \frac{\sigma}{u_\star} \right).\label{eqn:sigma_ustar}
% \end{equation}

\section{Deriving the Uncertainties}

According to the Law of the Wall, the velocity profile $u(z)$ as a function of elevation above the surface $z$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    u(z) = \frac{u_\star}{\kappa} \ln \left( \frac{z}{z_\star} \right),\label{eqn:uz_profile}
\end{equation}
where $u_\star$ is the friction velocity, $\kappa$ is von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n's constant (0.4), and $z_\star$ is the roughness length. (N.B. $z_\star$ is usually denoted as $z_0$, but for notational convenience, we will use this alternate notation.) This equation can be re-cast as a linear equation:
\begin{equation}
    y(x) = m x + b,\label{eqn:linear_eqn}
\end{equation}
with $x = \ln \left( z/z_0 \right)$ with $z_0$ the height of the lowest anemometer, $m = u_\star/\kappa$, $b = -\left(u_\star/\kappa\right) \ln\left( z_\star/z_0 \right)$.

Assume there are $N$ anemometers strung along a mast with the $i$th anemometer at a height $z_i$ (with $i \in [0, N-1]$). Usually, the anemometers are spaced logarithmically, i.e. $z_{i+1}/z_i = \delta z$ with $\delta z$ a constant for all $i$ (which translates into a regular spacing $\delta x = \ln(z_{i+1}/z_i)$ for the $x_i$). The $i$th anemometer will measure windspeed $y_i = y(x_i)$ with an uncertainty or scatter $\sigma_i$. Traditionally, we would estimate the best-fit slope $m$ and intercept $b$ (and therefrom $u_\star$ and $z_\star$) by minimizing $\chi^2$:
\begin{equation}
    \chi^2 = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left( \frac{y_i - b - m x_i}{\sigma_i} \right)^2.\label{eqn:chisq}
\end{equation}
Standard linear regression gives analytic solutions for $b$, $m$, and their associated uncertainties, $\sigma_b$ and $\sigma_m$, and covariance $\sigma_{bm}$. In principle, each $\sigma_i$ might be different, but as an initial simplifying assumption, take $\sigma_i = \sigma = {\rm const.}$ This assumption yields
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_b^2 = 2\sigma^2 \frac{2N - 1}{N\left(N + 1\right)},\ 
    \sigma_m^2 = 2\sigma^2 \frac{12}{\delta x^2 N \left( N^2 - 1 \right)},\ 
    \sigma_{bm} = \frac{6 \sigma^2}{N \left( N + 1\right) \delta x \label{eqn:sigma_b-and-sigma_m} }\\
\end{equation}

We can use these expressions to derive uncertainties on the shear velocity $u_\star$ and roughness $z_\star$. For example, 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{z_\star} = \frac{z_\star}{m} \sqrt{ \sigma_b^2 + \left( \frac{b}{m} \right)^2 \sigma_m^2 - 2 \left( \frac{b}{m} \right) \sigma_{b m}},
\end{equation}

    \caption{Uncertainties $\sigma_X$ for estimates of the roughness scale $z_\star$ and shear velocity $u_\star$ as a function of the number of measured wind profile points. The different line styles also show the dependence for various logarithmic spacings of the points relative to the bottom-most point at $z_0$. For example, for $z_i = 2^i z_0$, $z_1 = 2 z_0$, $z_2 = 2^2 z_0$, etc.}
